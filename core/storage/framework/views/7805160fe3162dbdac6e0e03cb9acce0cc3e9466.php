<br><strong>1. Bank Transfer Authorization</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When your checking account is used as your funding source, you are requesting that we initiate on your behalf an electronic transfer from your bank account. For these transactions, CuminUp will make electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association ("NACHA") from your bank account in the amount you authorize.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Company to make the ACH transfer, and once you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer and Company may resubmit any ACH debit you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds, except as otherwise provided by NACHA's ACH rules, or applicable law.</p>
